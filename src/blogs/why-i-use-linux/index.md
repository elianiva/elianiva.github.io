## Introduction
[[snippet]]
| G'day everyone! In this post, I will tell you guys the reason why I use Linux and how I know Linux. Well, the correct term here should be GNU/Linux but it's _way_ too long let's be honest. So, whenever I say Linux, what I mean is GNU/Linux. Let's start with how I know Linux.

## Origin
### My first laptop
It all started when I want to buy my first laptop. Roughly about 9 months ago. It runs Intel Celeron N4000 processor, which is pretty bad (yeah, I know). At that time, I didn't know about Thinkpad which most of people said has the best value for its price. So, I do some quick research on how ~~slow~~ fast this processor runs. It turns out, it's pretty bad.

### How I know Linux
I heard a lot of people say that Windows 10 is heavy for a slow processor like mine. It's bloat, it's too heavy, too many things going on, there's some malicious virus that can easily infect your computer, yaddi yadda. To be honest, I became a bit sad at that time. Then I came across a post on Facebook saying something like "Try Linux if your laptop/pc isn't powerful enough to run windows." Then I start to wonder, what is this guy talking about? Linux? I never heard that before.

I became interested in that. Bare in mind that I don't have any laptop yet. I don't know why I love to read some articles about Linux and joined on several groups even if I don't have any machine that runs Linux (I even help people solve issues that they have on their Linux machine even though I don't have any laptop. That's quite something if you ask me). It's an interesting operating system (mainly because I never heard of it). Somehow, I like the fact that most people don't use it. I like to be different. Finally, after about a month, I bought my very first laptop.

### My first distribution
Linux has so many distributions. Like, a gazillion of them. But from what I observe, there are only a few "big boys" that stands out from the others. Some of them are Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, Manjaro, OpenSUSE, Fedora, RHEL, PopOS, etc. I got confused easily on which one is the best for me. Then I decided to check what's that guy is using on Facebook.

The guy on Facebook runs [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org). I was like, "Why did he choose that? That's a silly name for Linux." Not gonna lie, that's my first impression lol. About a week later, I tried to install one of Linux distribution after getting convinced enough. The one that I chose was [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com). At that time, I installed Linux Mint 19.1 XFCE Edition. I was so happy to be able to install Linux. Unfortunately, I lost my first screenshot on Linux Mint.

### Changing distribution
A month has passed. I feel pretty comfortable with Linux. Then, there was this news saying that Ubuntu dropped their support for 32bit libraries. Do you remember that news? I was like, "Well, that's fine I guess. What's wrong with that?" Little did I know, 32bit libraries are what most games depend on. Then I started to panic and confused lmao.

I was like, "Oh come on. I'm already comfortable with my current setup. I still want to play some games but I don't want to change my distribution." Yep, that's literally what I said. And you know what? f*** it. Imma change my distribution. I decided to choose Manjaro since it's not based on Ubuntu. Yep, the one that I've mentioned before. A distribution that I thought has a stupid name (I felt so guilty now lol). Then I started to think, "Who cares about names anyway. As long as it is usable, it's good."

Finally, I installed it. I took a quick screenshot after installing it because I was so excited. Here, take a look!

Manjaro is based on Arch. Some people say that it's Arch without all of its fuss. I mean, it's true. At the time I'm writing this, I use Arch. For beginners that want to try Archlinux, it's a good starting point. I ended up using it for nearly 8 months. It was a great experience. That came from the same person that also makes fun of its name. I know, I'm such a hypocrite lmao.

## Rabbit hole
### How do I know Window Manager
Well, I've been using XFCE for about 4 months maybe. I started to feel it's a bit sluggish. I know that Linux is so modular. You can change anything, literally _anything_. So surely, I can change my current Desktop Environment. There I am, searching for a Desktop Environment that is lighter than XFCE. Then I came across what's called Window Manager on Youtube.

I was like, "Window Manager? What's that? Well, whatever that is I should try it." There are 2 kinds of Window Manager; tiling and stacking. Windows and MacOS use the stacking system where each window can overlap each other. Unlike stacking, Tiling Window Manager automatically spawns window so it doesn't stack. Like its name, tiling. It automatically resizes your window depending on how many windows are currently open. Let me give you a quick comparison.

![Tiling](https://res.cloudinary.com/irrellia/image/upload/v1582769300/why-i-use-linux/Shot_2020-02-27_08-28_uwijpc.png)
![Stacking](https://res.cloudinary.com/irrellia/image/upload/v1582769302/why-i-use-linux/Shot_2020-02-27_08-29_wgsb9f.png)

The first one is tiling, the second one is stacking. Window Manager that I use to take that screenshot is i3-Gaps. It's a tiling Window Manager, but it also has floating mode (basically the same as stacking). As you can see, Tiling Window Manager doesn't have the classic 3 buttons that you usually see on Windows, MacOS, or Linux with Desktop Environment. Everything is controlled through keybinds.

### My first Window Manager
My first window manager is [i3wm](https://i3wm.org). I installed it and using a config from a video on youtube. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQQXN-DWueA) is the video, and [here](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/i3-starterpack) is the config. I was so happy because it looks so slick. I looked at other people screenshot using i3, then I notice something's missing. Dem gaps. It felt so claustrophobic without any gaps. I didn't know that there was i3 with gaps called i3-gaps. I installed it, I forgot what's the detail but everything was messed up. I gave up. I went back to XFCE.

A week has passed, I want to try i3-gaps again. But this time, I'm gonna start from scratch. After tinkering around for about 3 days, I finally reach my peak comfort. Keybinds are set, the colour scheme is also set, the status bar is set. You know what will happen next right? Yep, time to post to r/unixporn.

Alright, I gotta stop here about Window Manager because that in itself could be another blog post.

## Conclusion
I became somewhat 'masochist' Linux user this past 8 months. No DE, it's bloat. Use VIM, any other Text Editor is bloat (Might make this as a post too). Use TUI based app if I can. I never thought that I would love Linux as I currently am.

A first, I'm afraid that I can't install Windows on my new laptop. Who would've thought that in the end, I use Archlinux which some people say that it's difficult to install. I think it's not that hard, follow the wiki and you're set (said someone who had failed to install Archlinux 3 times lmao).

Alright, this post will end right here. I might post why I use VIM/Window Managers next time. See ya in the next post everyone, have a good day!
